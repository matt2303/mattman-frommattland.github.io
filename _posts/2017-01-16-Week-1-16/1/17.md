    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Trial and error was a good method for working with the Fuse boxes. I still feel like I do not know enough to be confident on using them properly but I am getting through the coding easier as I have past knowledge from last year.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to lean to engage my partner more as I feel like I am doing most of the work. I also need to get more used to the saving side of things as at the end of the lesson I am rushed and I feel under pressure. It does not help that my partner doesn't know and will not try.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to include my partner more and keep trying to get to know the Fuse Box more and more. I will also try to proceed more. The reason I did not proceed enough today was because we did not know what we were doing enough.</td>
